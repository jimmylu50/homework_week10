                        GDP Per Capita is one of the most important indicators which reflects a nation's development in
                        the economic sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is clear that countries such as United States and Australia have the best economic
                        development, which
                        also indicate that their citizens are doing better than most people in other countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, large amount of countries in Africa have very low GDP per capita, showing that they
                        are rather underdeveloped.

                        On the other hand, general necessity is another means of looking at how different nations have
                        developed
                        over the years.

                    <p>
                        Basic sanitation is definitely one of the impacting factors which reflect living quality of
                        people.
                        As shown in the line graph on the right, it indicates that there is a steady increase in basic
                        sanitation level across different regions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also clear to see that there is a significant increase in basic sanitation level for
                        underdeveloped regions compared to
                        first-world continents.

                        As for negative consequences of world development, more CO2 emission
                        had to be made for the improvement of human life quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the interactive scatterplot, we can see that the population and CO2 emission at each nation
                        seem to be
                        somewhat positively correlated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we scroll through the past 20 years, it is clear that with more population,
                        more CO2 is emitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we can see that as we advance through the years, the life expectancy increases
                        in almost all nations due to better life quality.

                        CO2 is the one of the components that are responsible for global warming and it is
                        produced from burning of fossil fuels, which is frequently done for various uses
                        in human lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is clear that East Asia has seen the greatest increase in CO2 emission
                        across all continents in the world. This is most likely due to the rise of China
                        becoming that world factory and producing more products than ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from China, most of the continents have a steady increase of CO2 emission over the
                        past decades, which further imposes the danger of global warming on
                        future generations.

                    In the interactive scatterplot, it presents correlations between the factors of "Population", "CO2 Emission"
                    and "Number of people in Labor Force". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As shown, there is a strong positive correlation between "Population" and "Labor", meaning that 
                    with more people in the society, there are more people in workforce. This can possibly indicate 
                    that new jobs are created across various fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the relationship between "CO2" and "Population" is also somewhat positively
                    correlated.

                <p>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, it can be concluded that with general world development,
                    there are positive and negative impacts to the world and life quality
                    of humans. We should aim to achieve a good balance between the positives 
                    and negatives, and make the future brighter all generations at stake.
