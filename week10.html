                        GDP Per Capita is one of the most important indicators which reflects a nation's development in
                        the economic sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is clear that countries such as United States and Australia have the best economic
                        development, which
                        also indicate that their citizens are doing better than most people in other countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, large amount of countries in Africa have very low GDP per capita, showing that they
                        are rather underdeveloped.

                        As for negative consequences of world development, more CO2 emission
                        had to be made for the improvement of human life quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the interactive scatterplot, we can see that the population and CO2 emission at each nation
                        seem to be
                        somewhat positively correlated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we scroll through the past 20 years, it is clear that with more population,
                        more CO2 is emitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we can see that as we advance through the years, the life expectancy increases
                        in almost all nations due to better life quality.
